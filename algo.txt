                        Maximal Matching:

1. Matching: A set of pairwise non adjacent edges in a graph. 
2. Maximal Matching: A Matching to which if any more edges added becomes no longer a matching at all.
3. Maximum Matching: A Maximal Matching with maximum edges.
4. Perfect Matching: A Matching which covers all the vertices

Note: Every Perfect Matching is Maximum and hence Maximal.

Given a Matching
5. Alternating Path: is a path in which edges belong alternatively between matching and not matching
6. Augmenting Path: is an alternating path that starts from and ends in unmatched vertices.

Note: Matching is maximum iff it doesn't have an augmenting path

Algorithm for Maximal Matching:

*** Can there exist more than one augmenting path in a maximal matching ***

Vertex Cover: For all (u,v) belongs to Edge set either u belongs to C or v belongs to C then C is called minimum vertex cover

Minimum vertex cover for general graphs is np-complete.

For bipartite graphs size of maximal matching is equal to the size of the minimum vertex cover
